	<h1>Run a Game At Phantasm!</h1>
	<h2 class="left">What is Involved in Running a Game at Phantasm?</h2>
	    <ul>
    		<li>You
will have a 4 hour time slot to run your game. It is a good idea to
assume that it will take ½ an hour to get the game started by the time
you explain the rules, the characters and the setting. Also keep in
mind that a 15 minute break will be given at the half way mark.</li>       
    		<li>Try
to run a game that is light on rules, so that someone who hasn&#8217;t played
the game before, or someone who hasn&#8217;t played in a while can still
enjoy it.</li>
    		<li>Get in touch with us &amp; let us know what
you would like to run &amp; give us an idea of your story telling /
game mastering experience. We would like to have some idea of your
experience so that we can ensure a high quality of games being offered
at Phantasm.</li> 
    		<li>After that we need to know is how many
players you are comfortable with. Generally we suggest a limit of 6
players at each table. But it is totally up to you.</li>
      		<li>We
would also like to know which time slot or slots you would like to run
your game. We can&#8217;t guaranty a time slot for you but we will try to do
our best. There are 5 time slots, 3 on Saturday and 2 on Sunday. They
are; <br />
<table>
    <tr>
    <td>Saturday 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td align="right">3:00 PM - 7:00 PM</td></tr>
    <tr><td align="right">8:00 PM - 12:00 AM</td></tr>
    <tr><td align="right">Sunday  10:00 AM - 2:00 PM</td></tr>
    <tr><td align="right">3:00 PM - 7:00 PM</td></tr>
</table></li> 
             
            </ul>
	<p>If
you see a game that you would like to run that is already being run,
offer to run it anyway. Variety is the spice of life &amp; storytellers
tell their tales in a varied but equally enjoyable manner.</p>
	<h3 class="left">Reasons to Story Tell / Game Master at a Convention:</h3>
	   <ul>
    		<li>It&#8217;s a chance to run your favourite RPG system, maybe one that you haven&#8217;t run in a while?</li>
    		<li>You can show off your story telling / game master ability.</li>
    		<li>It
is an opportunity to run a one shot short story where you design the
story &amp; the characters allowing you to run a more complex story.</li>
    		<li>For every game session that you run at Phantasm you get to play in one for free!</li>
		<li>Just for the chance to meet new players &amp; experience different styles of role-playing.</li>
    		<li>You can flex your creative muscle &amp; push your limits.</li>
    		<li>It gives you an opportunity to try out new ideas, or use ones that you haven&#8217;t been able to work into your home group.</li>
    		<li>It gives you a chance to design a functional party with interesting histories.</li>
    		<li>You get a chance to see how your story turns out when it is run with different players.</li>
    		<li>$ 5 off of a Phantasm t-shirt.</li>
    		<li>Some of the best prizes will be going to the best storytellers.</li>
    		<li>You could win the &#8220;Hammer of Plot&#8221;!!! The Phantasm storyteller of the year award !!!</li>   
           <li>You never pay to run a game, so combined with the free game you get for running a game you could run two games and
               get a weekend pass for $5!</li>
	  </ul>	
          <p>Phantasm uses a <a href="XCard.pdf" target="_blank">"X-Card"</a> at all of our RPG tables, and encourage all of our story tellers to use them in their game.</p>
