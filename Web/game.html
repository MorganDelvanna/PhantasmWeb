                <h1>Run a Game At Phantasm!</h1>
                <h2 class="left">What is Involved in Running a Game at Phantasm?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        You
                        will have a 4 hour time slot to run your game. It is a good idea to
                        assume that it will take � an hour to get the game started by the time
                        you explain the rules, the characters and the setting. Also keep in
                        mind that a 15 minute break will be given at the half way mark.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Try
                        to run a game that is light on rules, so that someone who hasn&#8217;t played
                        the game before, or someone who hasn&#8217;t played in a while can still
                        enjoy it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Get in touch with us &amp; let us know what
                        you would like to run &amp; give us an idea of your story telling /
                        game mastering experience. We would like to have some idea of your
                        experience so that we can ensure a high quality of games being offered
                        at Phantasm.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After that we need to know is how many
                        players you are comfortable with. Generally we suggest a limit of 6
                        players at each table. But it is totally up to you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        We
                        would also like to know which time slot or slots you would like to run
                        your game. We can&#8217;t guaranty a time slot for you but we will try to do
                        our best. There are 5 time slots, 3 on Saturday and 2 on Sunday. They
                        are; <br />

                            <li>Saturday
                                <ul>
                                    <li>10:00 AM - 2:00 PM</li>
                                    <li>3:00 PM - 7:00 PM</li>
                                    <li>8:00 PM - 12:00 AM</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Sunday
                                <ul>
                                    <li>10:00 AM - 2:00 PM</li>
                                    <li>3:00 PM - 7:00 PM</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                    If
                    you see a game that you would like to run that is already being run,
                    offer to run it anyway. Variety is the spice of life &amp; storytellers
                    tell their tales in a varied but equally enjoyable manner.
                </p>
                <h3 class="left">Reasons to Story Tell / Game Master at a Convention:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>It&#8217;s a chance to run your favourite RPG system, maybe one that you haven&#8217;t run in a while?</li>

                    <li>
                        It
                        is an opportunity to run a one shot short story where you design the
                        story &amp; the characters allowing you to run a more complex story.
                    </li>
                    <li>For every game session that you run at Phantasm you get to play in one for free!</li>
                    <li>Just for the chance to meet new players &amp; experience different styles of role-playing.</li>
                    <li>You can flex your creative muscle &amp; push your limits.</li>
                    <li>It gives you an opportunity to try out new ideas, or use ones that you haven&#8217;t been able to work into your home group.</li>
