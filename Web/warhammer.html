                        I review the files to see if it has flagged your list with any errors.

                <h2 class="left">Army Limitations</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>No limitations on the number of detachments</li>
                    <li>At our double events no may be 18 Power or above. At our Singles event one Super Heavy Vehicles or Gargantuan Creature model is allowed per army.</li>
                    <li>
                        All models must be WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get)
                        So the wargear that your model uses must be on the model
                    </li>
                    <li>If you want to use a “Counts As” models, contact us ahead of time. They will be reviewed on case-by-case bases. This is primarily not an issue if there is no Games Workshop model for that unit. However if there is a Games Workshop model for the unit we’d prefer you use it, if you’d like to do otherwise message us. We are pretty open to sweet looking models</li>
                    <li>Armies must be Battle-forged</li>
                    <li>Warhammer 40k is a rapidly evolving game. At Brawl in the hall we allow codex, supplements, data slates, Forge World and other rules sources. The only limitation we place is that you must be able to currently purchase those rules from Games Workshop/ Forge World in order to use those rules at Brawl in the Hall.</li>
                    <li>A rule set for a unit must be at least 30 days old before being allowed into Brawl in the Hall.</li>
                    <li>For our doubles events, you and your partner's army may not interact in any way. The best way to view this is to consider each others army a "Allies of Conveniences".</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="left">Prizes:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Door Prizes, commonly include pizza & miniature gift certificates, miniatures, and modeling supplies, and we make best efforts to get a fair number of these out.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="left">Scoring:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        GENERAL - Each round will be scored 2 pt – loss, 4 pt tie, 6 pt win along with
                        three bonus battle points for the secondary objectives. So 9 points maximum per
                        game.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        PAINTING
                        <ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-left: 15px">
                            <li> 0 - some or all of the models do not have at least 3 colours on them</li>
                            <li> 1 - all models have at least three colours on them</li>
                            <li> 2 - models look very nice, including some of but not limited to: being based/ nice detail work/ blending/ highlighting/ conversions/ transfers etc."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SPORTSMANSHIP- Will be scored for points each game via 3 yes/ no questions:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Did you enjoy playing them?</li>
                            <li>Did you enjoy playing against their army?</li>
                            <li>Were they transparent with the special rules for their army, so you weren’t blind-sided or surprised?</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Please note that this system allows a player to ding you a point if they did not fun playing your army, I've only ever seen this done when someone brings a "Win at all Cost" or SPAM'ed list.</li>
                </ul>
                <i>If a player consistently receives poor scores on Sportsmanship, Phantasm reserves the right to rescind their invitation to our future events.</i>

                    </li>
                    <li>We are using the Warhammer 40K, rulebook along with official GW Errata/ FAQ’s found at the GW Site. Rules that aren’t clearly addressed in the rules will be settled by our judges taking into account RAW (rules as written) as well as RAI (rules as intended). If there is something specific you are concerned about drop us a line</li>
                    <li>We aim to have large line of sight blocking terrain on most tables. That means it will be easy for your Land Raider to get a cover save on most tables and even a flyer on some tables. There will be roads on a number of tables. Most tables will be either urban or rural in nature. All terrain is fully painted.</li>
