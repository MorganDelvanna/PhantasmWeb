                <h1>Inclusion</h1>
                <p>Working to make our event inclusive is a journey. We always welcome thoughts and input on the subject. When you contribute your thoughts to dwatson@nexicom.net your input will be going directly to the event organizer.</p>

                <p>Harassment or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated at any Phantasm event. We welcome all peoples of the world. We will not accept any unwelcoming words, actions or behaviors against our guests. We accord respect to all persons. Diversity builds our community.</p>

                <p>Harassment can be defined as any unwelcome action by any person, whether verbal or physical, on a single or repeated basis, which humiliates, insults or degrades. “Unwelcome” in this context means any actions which the harasser knows, or ought reasonably to know, are not wanted by the victim of the harassment.</p>

                    <h2>What do we do to make this an inclusive environment?</h2>
                    <ul class="withLine">
                        <li>We developed a harassment policy. It is on this site, on the first page of our booklet, on posters throughout the event, each table, and it is read out by the head of the event at the start of the event.</li>

                        <li>We have a X-card that is used on every table for this event. All the RPG tables, all the Board Game tables and all the miniature wargame demo tables. On the card is a description of how and why it’s used. A summary of our harassment policy and the means to contact the event organizers in real time. The concept of the card is reviewed by convention organizers at the start of every event. At the front desk we have a stack of X-Cards should anyone want one for the convention or for their home game.</li>

                        <li>At our front desk if you have a problem come up you may speak to the event organizer, or if you’d prefer you may speak to one of our female volunteers. Alternatively, you may also submit a concern digitally in real time. Our staff are clearly marked with bright shirts.</li>

                        <li>We do not offer advance sales, we do offer a pay per session option. We don’t require you to lock in for a weekend but rather offer the option of paying one session at a time. The cost all works out to be the same, about $2 per hour of enjoyment. Coming in to check out the site, or shop around is free.</li>

                        <li>When you come in if you’re not sure what games to try, talk to us. Tell us what you like in your games & we’ll steer you towards storytellers and games we think you’d enjoy. We’re happy to introduce you to the Storytellers you’ll be playing with. We do also have Lunch and Learns, and Pub Crawls for folks to get a chance to talk about the craft of gaming.</li>
