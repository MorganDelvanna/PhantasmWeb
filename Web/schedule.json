Based on 80s action films like Jean Claude Van Damme's \"Bloodsport\", and video games like \"Final Fight\", explore underground gambling dens, biker bars, dojos, and heartache. The rules are easy to learn and taught at the table. If you're looking for a different role-playing experience, this is the chosen one. No retreat. No surrender.\n"

Take on smaller missions to earn creds. Then, put those right back into more experienced runners, and better gear.

I expanded into Miniature war gaming with Warhammer 40,00 with an Eldar and a Space Wolves Army. I decided that after surviving the supposed end of the world of 2012, I felt that a great reward for my survivability would be learning to play a new game. I started playing Hordes and then moved to Include Warmachine. Recently I have started to add the iron Kingdoms RPG to my repertoire of games supported and have had a fantastic time hosting and playing this RPG."
