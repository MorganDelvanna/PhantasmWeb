                <h1>What is Role Playing?</h1>
                <p>
                    Well
                    that isn&#8217;t as simple of a question as you may think. Role Playing has
                    grown &amp; developed over the years to become a diverse array of
                    activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At its core it is a combination of improvisational
                    acting and cooperative storytelling. A group of players sit around a
                    table with a single storyteller directing the story with the other
                    participants playing characters that interact with the story &amp;
                    setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be anything from an intense session of plot
                    and character development to a bunch of fiends sitting around table
                    sharing laughs and stories.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Role playing games have diverged
                    from this point over the years to include live action role playing
                    (LARP) &amp; tabletop strategy games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Live action role playing
                    allows player to develop their improvisation acting skills by removing
                    the players from a table setting and allowing them to interact in real
                    time on a dynamic stage like setting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tabletop strategy games
                    may be best thought as a dynamic game of chess. These games use pieces
                    or miniatures with varying defense moves and attack abilities to
                    achieve a variety of goals in a wide range of settings.
                </p>
                <p>Whatever the form the end result with role playing games (RPG) is a great deal of fun.</p>
                <h2>Phantasm's Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    My
                    goal with Phantasm is to provide an opportunity to Peterborough&#8217;s Role
                    Players to get together and recharge their creative batteries while
                    sampling some of the best new games industry has to offer or take a
                    break with an old favorite.
