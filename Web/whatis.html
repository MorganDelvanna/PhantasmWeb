        <h1>What is Role Playing?</h1>
        <p>Well
that isn&#8217;t as simple of a question as you may think. Role Playing has
grown &amp; developed over the years to become a diverse array of
activities.</p>
	<p>At its core it is a combination of improvisational
acting and cooperative storytelling. A group of players sit around a
table with a single storyteller directing the story with the other
participants playing characters that interact with the story &amp;
setting.</p>
	<p>This can be anything from an intense session of plot
and character development to a bunch of fiends sitting around table
sharing laughs and stories.</p>
	<p>Role playing games have diverged
from this point over the years to include live action role playing
(LARP) &amp; tabletop strategy games.</p>
	<p>Live action role playing
allows player to develop their improvisation acting skills by removing
the players from a table setting and allowing them to interact in real
time on a dynamic stage like setting.</p>
	<p>Tabletop strategy games
may be best thought as a dynamic game of chess. These games use pieces
or miniatures with varying defense moves and attack abilities to
achieve a variety of goals in a wide range of settings.</p>
	<p>Whatever the form the end result with role playing games (RPG) is a great deal of fun.</p>
	<h2>Phantasm's Goal</h2>
	<p>My
goal with Phantasm is to provide an opportunity to Peterborough&#8217;s Role
Players to get together and recharge their creative batteries while
sampling some of the best new games industry has to offer or take a
break with an old favorite.</p>
